# shop-chatbot
This is the source code for a chatbot that converses with customers and helps them with their shopping. I have built in intelligence, such as recommendation based on past purchases, size suggestions, etc. The graphics are not up to the mark, but it is otherwise fully functional. Feel free to use the code in any projects.

(The game was created using Unity Version 2019.2.8f1 Personal. It works for Window standalone machines)
